    <div class="title">1S-VPN Privacy Policy</div>
<div class="one">
<div class="one1">
    <div class="title1">1. What information is collected and why?</div>
    <div class="one1_1">Surfshark respects your privacy, therefore we are committed to not process any information related to the online
    activity of our users. Surfshark is based in the jurisdiction, which does not require information storage or reporting.
    We do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session
    information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar information). Our servers do
    store information about your connection to a particular VPN server (user ID and/or IP address and connection time
    stamps), BUT this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session. And be
    assured that no information is stored about the websites you visit.</div>
</div>
<div class="one2">When you visit our Website or navigate within our app (collectively referred to as ‘Website’), we collect and use some
information to improve the performance of our Website. The information we collect on our Website may include anonymous
“traffic information” provided by the host or similar provider of such information (e.g. Google Analytics) that does not
personally identify you. This information is statistical and includes information about which pages on Surfshark’s
Website visitors visit and how long visitors stay on a particular page. It also provides information about what browser,
network, or device is used to visit our Website. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en. Also, when
you visit our Website, we may retain your IP address and a unique identifier of your device. This helps us identify
problems with our server, to administer our Website, or to display the content according to your preferences. The legal
basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to analyse and improve the performance of our Website and user
experience. That does not mean that we track your online activity while you use our Services.</div>
</div>

<div class="two">
    <div class="title1">When you use our Services, we collect and use the information for the following purposes:</div>
    <div class="title2">To provide our Services.</div>
    <div class="two1">We process limited information related to the use of our Services (registration information: e-mail, account
    registration date, information about subscription, encrypted password, when you use our Smart DNS feature – your IP
    address, when you use our Search tool – aggregated number of performed searches).
    For provision of our antivirus service (currently available for Windows, macOS and Android users) we also collect
    information about your devices on which you use the antivirus service. This information is needed to ensure the
    compliance with a limitation for the number of devices that one client may use for the antivirus service as provided in
    our Terms of Service. If you choose to use the Webcam Protection feature, we will not have access to your webcam,
    microphone, apps or files on your device. We will retain statistical information about the usage of this feature,
    including the number of times you received a request to access your camera or microphone, which preference you selected,
    whether this feature is turned on or off, how many apps you have included in the exclusion list. To provide statistics
    on what malware was detected, we will process malware name and type, country, OS, user ID; this information will be
    anonymized after 1 year.
    If you use our Alert service, you may enter email addresses which you would like to monitor for breaches. In such case
    we will retain this information. You may also enter your personal identity number (or social security number) and/or
    credit card number to monitor for related security breaches. When you choose to monitor your email address, you
    authorize us to look up additional information (usernames, passwords, full names, country, physical address or IP
    addresses) related to that email in known data breaches, which, if found, is provided to you in the platform. We do not
    look up for such additional information when you choose to monitor your credit card or social security numbers. As
    regards this data, we retain it in encrypted form and even we cannot use or review it.
    If you use the Dedicated IP service, we will process your email address, therefore, certain online activities can be
    traced back to your account information as long as you don’t select an anonymous Dedicated IP option after the Dedicated
    IP installation process. Anonymous Dedicated IP option removes any information we have in our database about your
    Dedicated IP address.
    If you use the Alternative ID service, we will process your email address. To be able to use this service, you will have
    to verify your email address. The emails you receive via Alternative ID along with sender and recipient email server IP
    address, sender email address, recipient email address and timestamps are deleted as soon as they are forwarded to your
    email address. We use a trusted email service provider to facilitate this service.
    Legal basis for the processing of information is performance of a contract to which you are a party. Please note that
    this information is necessary to enter into a contract and if you do not provide this information (or if we cannot
    retain this information), we will not be able to provide you with our Services.</div>
</div>

<div class="three">
        <div class="title2">Analysing and improving the performance of our Services and user experience (when you use our Services).</div>
  <div class="two1"> To maintain a perfect quality of our Services and provide you with efficient support, we collect diagnostics information
and monitor crash reports on our apps and extensions. The information we collect contains aggregated performance
information, the frequency of use of our Services, unsuccessful connection attempts and other similar information.
Please note that diagnostics information does not contain uniquely identifiable information. However, if you face some
problems when using our apps, to solve these problems we may require your device information. We will access this
information only if you provide a separate consent for that.
When you permit us through a pop-up within our app, we collect your location data, i.e. only your WiFi name (Service Set
Identifier), which is stored on your device for the purpose of enabling “Auto-connect” feature, which extends to
“Trusted WiFi” networks. This feature allows our app to automatically connect to a server without your worry about it.
However, please rest assured that we do not share this information to any third party. In fact we do not store this
information on our end and it is stored only on your device.
In case we would process your personal information, legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to
analyse and improve the performance of our Website/Services and user experience.</div>
</div>

<div class="four">
<div class="title2">Offering our Services.</div>
<div class="two1"> We may contact you via email for this purpose, but we also encourage you to contact us via our online contact form to
get the best VPN offer for you. For us to be able to address your requests effectively, we may ask you to provide some
information about you. We will also use the provided information to contact you regarding any future offers that may be
of interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive emails from us, you can opt-out from receiving emails or unsubscribe at
support@surfshark.com or click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any correspondence. If you have multiple email addresses,
you will need to opt-out for each address in order to be removed from our active database.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent, your relationship with Surfshark or our
legitimate interest to conduct marketing activities.</div>
</div>

<div class="fife">
    <div class="title2">Communicating with users and customer support.</div>
    <div class="two1 "> We use user email address to: i) send important updates and announcements related to the use of our Services; ii)
    respond to user requests or inquiries. In addition to user email, we process your inquiry and other information that is
    provided by you during the conversation.
    When a user contacts us through a live chat on our website, we are able to see the user’s IP address. This information
    is needed to determine if the user is connected to our servers so that we can assist in solving related issues.
    Legal basis for the processing of personal information is performance of contract with you (in case of important
    communication related to our Services) or your consent (in case you submit an inquiry with our customer support).</div>
</div>

<div class="six">
    <div class="title2">To interact with you via social media.</div>
    <div class="two1"> Where you interact with us via social media, we will process social media profile information, inquiry information, post
    information and other information you provide us with.
    Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="seven">
<div class="title2">Advertising.</div>
<div class="two1"> We may receive certain information about you (cookie id, mobile device id, advertising IDs; and in case you use our
Trust DNS app – in app events, such information about what browser, network, or device is used to access and use Trust
DNS) from certain advertisers and advertising partners for analytical and advertising purposes. Our advertising partners
help us attribute sales, deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest-based
advertising and account-based advertising.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is our legitimate interest to deliver relevant ads and
promotional messages to you, and to attribute sales.
</div>
</div>

<div class="eight">
    <div class="title2">Accounting, payment, legal requirements and legal processes.</div>
    <div class="two1"> We are subject to accounting, tax and other statutory requirements. We may have to protect our legitimate interests and
    legal rights. In these cases we may be required to collect and store a limited amount of certain information: email
    address, subscription information, payment related information, legal documents.
    As for payment related information, our payment processing partners collect usual data necessary for payment processing
    and/or refund requests (transaction date, payer’s IP address, credit card number, credit card owner’s full name, in some
    jurisdictions also personal identity code, passport or identity card number and/or residence address). We process only
    very small part of this payment related information (part of the credit card number, payer’s IP address, payment amount,
    currency, date of payment and card expiry date) for solving payment related issues (such as fraud prevention cases). We
    also collect information about your residence country (and your state) as this information is needed to calculate
    applicable VAT/sales tax. If you elect so, we may retain your data which is used to generate and issue invoice for the
    rendered Services. If you choose the open banking payment method to pay for our Services, we will collect your name and
    surname, as well as your bank details.
    Legal basis for the processing of personal information is a legal obligation to which we are subject (in case we need to
    collect your information statutorily) and our legitimate interest to defend our rights and interests (in case of other
    legal processes related to you, if any).

    about them. We assure you, that we do not make decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling,
    which would produce legal effects concerning you.</div>
