                    <div class="one1_1">Thank you for visiting Surfshark! Please read the following information carefully. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE
                    PROVISIONS COVERING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF SERVICES AND CHANGE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. These Terms of Service govern
                    your access to and use of all Surfshark Services. This is a binding agreement. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS
                    OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES, YOU
                    AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Service indicate a person who created
                    Surfshark account and/or whose payment method is charged.</div>
               
                <div class="one1_1 margin">We may change these Terms of Service from time to time. We will post a notice on the Surfshark Site any time these Terms
                of Service have been amended or updated. It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service periodically, and if
                at any time you find these Terms of Service unacceptable, you must immediately leave the Surfshark Site and cease all
                use of our Services.
                When you agree to use our Services, which includes, but is not limited to: the use of our servers, routers, IP
                addresses, protocols, add-ons, software, applications, extensions, and other equipment, as well as any updates thereof,
                you agree to accept these Terms.</div>

            <div class="two">
                <div class="title1">1. What services does Surfshark provide?</div>
                <div class="two1">Surfshark provides virtual private network (VPN) services, also other privacy and cyber security related services
                (“Services”). Services include, but are not limited to VPN and other software, extensions, applications, information and
                content made available to you by Surfshark. A VPN is a secure way to protect your online activities by encrypting your
                data connection. Thus, third parties are unable to monitor your network traffic, such as websites, downloaded files, or
                other used internet services. With Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of
                your location.
                No-logs Policy is one of the most important features of our Services. It means your activities are not in any way
                logged, retained, or transferred to third parties when you connect to our Services. We do not collect any information
                about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection
                time stamps, network traffic or any other similar data). We can ensure such policy as we are based in the jurisdiction,
                which does not require data storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our Services are automated.
                Moreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide Services to
                you. To prevent service abuse, our servers store your user ID and/or IP address, and connection time stamps, but this
                information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.
                Please note that if you use a dedicated IP address (a unique internet protocol address assigned exclusively to you), it
                will encrypt your internet traffic and hide your real IP address and virtual location. However, since it’s tied to your
                email address, certain online activities can be traced back to your account information as far as you don’t select an
                anonymous Dedicated IP option after the Dedicated IP installation process. Anonymous Dedicated IP option removes any
                information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address. Therefore, after you choose this, you will have to
                manually set up new devices and retain your own information as we will not have any links about who and how uses your
                Dedicated IP address.
                More information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at
                https://surfshark.com/privacy
                We do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities committed by using Surfshark Services. As we
                are not logging any information about your activities, you are using the Surfshark Services at your own responsibility.
                Surfshark will not be liable in any way or form for illegal actions done by you arising through or from the use of our
                Services.</div>

            <div class="three">
                <div class="title1">2. Do I have to create an account?</div>
                <div class="two1">In order to use some of the Surfshark Services, you will be asked to set up an account. You are solely responsible for
                all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your
                account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is
                accessible..</div>
            </div>

            <div class="four">
                <div class="title1">3. What happens if I share or lose my account information?</div>
                <div class="two1"> If you open an account to use or access the Services, you must complete the registration process by providing the
                complete and accurate information requested on the registration form. You may be asked to provide an e-mail address and
                password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You may not sell, or trade
                that Account to any other person.
                You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, e-mail address, or password. We are not
                liable for any loss that you or any third party incur as a result of someone else using your password, either with or
                without your knowledge. We reserve the right to terminate your account at any time.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="fife">
            <div class="title1">4. What is Surfshark payment, automatic renewal and refund policy?</div>
            <div class="two1"> You can subscribe to Surfshark Services on a service period basis. After signing up for Surfshark Services you may
            choose a payment method. Only some of our Services are free of charge.
            Paid Surfshark Services renew automatically at the end of each service period and your chosen payment method is charged
            again, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments before the automatic renewal. By entering your payment
            details you agree with the automatic renewal. We will inform you in advance by email about the automatic renewal of your
            subscription (if it is longer than one month).
            We will send the first receipt for your purchased Services to your email. All later receipts will be sent to your
            Surfshark account (to see those receipts please log in to your account, click on “My account”, select “Subscriptions”
            and then see the receipts in the “Invoices & receipts” section).
            Surfshark may change the price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other subscription terms
            from time to time and will communicate any price or other changes to you in advance. Subject to applicable law, you
            accept the new price and terms by continuing to use the Services after the changes take effect. Please see currently
            applicable recurring subscription fees here.
            As a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days from the purchase has passed. Nevertheless,
            in the exceptional cases, we will consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can
            demonstrate that the Services which you purchased were not available or usable and that you made reasonable attempts to
            contact us regarding this issue. In such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of Services’ fees paid during
            the subscription period when the Services were not available or usable.
            If you purchase our subscription through iTunes/App Store/Amazon – we are not able to grant you a refund, as
            subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store/Amazon are subject to iTunes/App Store/Amazon refund policies. In such
            a case, you would have to contact a specific store for a refund. Surfshark cannot refund any purchases made from our
            resellers. In this case, refunds are handled according to the terms and conditions of the reseller from which the
            product was purchased.
            Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent
            amount in US Dollars is refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).
            You have a right to delete your account at any time, however, deleted accounts will not be refunded for the unused part
            of the ongoing service period.
            If you decide to use an anonymous Dedicated IP option which can be selected after the installation of your Dedicated IP,
            this will cause a removal of all the information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address. Taking that
            into account, we will no longer be able to grant you a refund, as we will not have any possibility to establish any
            links between you and a particular Dedicated IP.
            We reserve the right not to issue refund in the event of a breach of these Terms.
            Any fees charged by Surfshark are exclusive of taxes. Nevertheless, we may calculate and add taxes or duties, including,
            but not limited to VAT, GST and other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you at the time of purchase.
            All payments are being processed by our own payment processing companies (Surfshark Limited, registered at Suite 1, 3rd
            Floor 11-12 St. James’s Square, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4LB and Surfshark Inc., registered at 16192 Coastal
            Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958, County of Sussex) with help of third-party providers (see our Privacy Policy).</div>

                <div class="two1"> We are subject to accounting, tax and other statutory requirements. We may have to
                    protect our legitimate interests and
                    legal rights. In these cases we may be required to collect and store a limited amount of certain
                    information: email
                    address, subscription information, payment related information, legal documents.
                    As for payment related information, our payment processing partners collect usual data necessary for
                    payment processing
                    and/or refund requests (transaction date, payer’s IP address, credit card number, credit card
                    owner’s full name, in some
                    jurisdictions also personal identity code, passport or identity card number and/or residence
                    address). We process only
                    very small part of this payment related information (part of the credit card number, payer’s IP
                    address, payment amount,
                    currency, date of payment and card expiry date) for solving payment related issues (such as fraud
                    prevention cases). We
                    also collect information about your residence country (and your state) as this information is needed
                    to calculate
                    applicable VAT/sales tax. If you elect so, we may retain your data which is used to generate and
                    issue invoice for the
                    rendered Services. If you choose the open banking payment method to pay for our Services, we will
                    collect your name and
                    surname, as well as your bank details.
                    Legal basis for the processing of personal information is a legal obligation to which we are subject
                    (in case we need to
                    collect your information statutorily) and our legitimate interest to defend our rights and interests

                    making sure that every user of our Services gets the full experience from their chosen plan. To deliver on this
                    commitment, we have implemented an automated infrastructure maintenance system which continuously manages our network
                    capacity.
                    
                    Although one of the core premises of Surfshark is an unlimited number of simultaneous connections (except for Antivirus
                    service), there might be some users who exploit it, and this might have an adverse effect on the quality of our Services
                    as well as usage experience for the rest of our users. Such users can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized
                    resellers, organizers of illicit activities which involve usage of a very large number of devices, and other.
                    
                    Our Fair Usage Policy manages inappropriate use of our Services and guarantees that the Services can be used fairly by
                    everyone. Under the Fair Usage Policy, we reserve the right to enable limits of an immoderate number of simultaneously
                    connected devices in our network maintenance system in order to make sure that none of our users are affected by
                    potentially deteriorated quality of the Services.

                <div class="two1 ">If you have contracted Surfshark before October 1, 2021, your contract is concluded with Surfshark Ltd., a company
                established in the British Virgin Islands. If you have contracted Surfshark on October 1, 2021 or after, your contract
                is concluded with Surfshark B.V., a company established in the Netherlands.
                
                Surfshark has two legal entities that handle the contractual agreements with our customers – Surfshark Ltd., a company
                established in the British Virgin Islands, and Surfshark B.V., a company established in the Netherlands. No matter which
                Surfshark company you have contracted (Surfshark Ltd., if it was before October 1, 2021, or Surfshark B.V., if it was
                after the aforementioned data), these Terms of Service (contract between You and Surfshark) shall be construed in
                accordance with and governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, without reference to their rules regarding
                conflicts of law. This means that contracts with all our customers are governed by the same laws, i.e. laws of the
                British Virgin Islands.

                to under the mandatory laws of your country of residence. You hereby agree that the judicial proceeding to resolve
                claims relating to the Terms of Service will be brought in the courts of British Virgin Islands, unless the laws of your
                country of residence have mandatory provisions that apply to the dispute that cannot be overridden by the contractual
                choice of law.</div>
